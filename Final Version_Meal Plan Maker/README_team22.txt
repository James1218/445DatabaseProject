Please follow the instruction:

1. Import team22.zip file with Netbeans
2. Go to TSP/Source Packages/tsp/TspGUI.java and run
3.(optional) if cannot create project after step 1, import mysql-connector-java-5.1.38-bin which is provided inside the zip file
4 (optional) if you fail step 1-3, then use executable team22Phase3.jar. This is not recommended because the executable file misses one picture which would lower our GUI score.
